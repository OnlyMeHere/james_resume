      <p>
      My varied experience gives me a resilient outlook on life. I see the common threads of Hard Work, Perseverance, Patience and Positive Attitude running through every successful business I've worked with. They are the foundation of my mode of operation. I seek those qualities in my coworkers and reflect them back in a positive feedback loop. My goal is to help others achieve greatness and in doing so I derive great satisfaction.
